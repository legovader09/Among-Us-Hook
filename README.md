**Prerequisites**:

 - Access to a Discord server's webhooks.
 - Among Us Bot: [[Discord.bots.gg]](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/754922494376542219)
 - Windows & Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2+

**Instructions:**
 1. Create a webhook on your server **(Server Settings > Integrations >
    Webhooks > New Webhook)**
 2. Specify the text channel that has been set up to be used by Among Us Bot. 
 3. Copy webhook URL as my app will ask you for this. Copy a
    voice channel's ID by **right clicking the channel > Copy channel ID**. The app will prompt you for this ID.
 4. Once setup, you should be able to Mute/Unmute
    everyone in that specific voice channel.

Note: If everyone is muted and the app is accidentally closed, everybody will be automatically unmuted.
Also, the unmute function may lag behind if you are in a full lobby. This is due to a fault with the Among Us Bot, and not with this app. The best workaround for now is double clicking the "Unmute" button.
